It's interesting because I just want a stopwatch/count up timer that is: dead simple (stop, start, reset), with a dead simple UI, but also has the ability to start the time from a time - so say you want to start the time from hour 80 or something, and lastly, remembers what the time was at in case you stop it manually or accidently (crashes, quits, etc etc) - so persistence bascially. Yet, nothing exactly like this exists anywhere... I have no idea why, so I had to make my own..🙄
